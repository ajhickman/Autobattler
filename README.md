# Autobattler
An autobattler-style game programmed in Ruby during Academy Pittsburgh. This was programmed in a group while in class by passing the code back and forth. There is an item shop to buy weapons, a shady healer, and when you battle monsters there's a random selection of monsters you can run into, with harder enemies becoming more likely the longer you survive.
